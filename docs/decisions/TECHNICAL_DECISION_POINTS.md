### 🔑 DECISION POINT 3: MEMORY ACCESS PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### **Decision Required**  
**Approve direct memory access patterns for PPU rendering performance?**

#### Technical Context  
PPU rendering is extremely performance-sensitive, requiring access to VRAM during pixel generation. Two approaches available:

**Option A: Abstracted Access (Slower)**
```typescript
// Through abstraction layers
const tileData = this.memoryBus.read(VRAM_BASE + tileOffset);
```

**Option B: Direct Access (Faster)**  
```typescript
// Direct memory access for performance
const tileData = this.vram[tileOffset];
```

#### Team Analysis
**Unanimous Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVE CONTROLLED DIRECT ACCESS**

**Performance Requirements**:
- Mode 3 (Pixel Transfer) must complete within 172-289 cycles
- 160×144 pixels generated 60 times per second (1,382,400 pixels/second)
- Memory access is the rendering bottleneck
- Abstraction layers add 20-30% overhead to hot path

**Architectural Controls**:
```typescript
class PPURenderer {
  private vram: Uint8Array;  // Direct access for performance
  
  // External interface maintains abstraction
  public getFrameBuffer(): ImageData {
    return this.frameBuffer.getImageData();
  }
  
  // Hardware accuracy through controlled access
  private renderScanline(): void {
    if (!this.memoryController.isVRAMAccessible()) {
      return; // Hardware behavior: blocked renders ignored
    }
    // Direct VRAM access for pixel generation
  }
}
```

#### Performance Impact Analysis

**Direct Access Benefits**:
- 20-30% rendering performance improvement
- Eliminates function call overhead in hot path
- Enables hardware-accurate timing
- Maintains 59.7 FPS target with headroom

**Architectural Safeguards**:

- Hardware restrictions properly enforced
- External interfaces maintain proper abstraction
- Memory access debugging capabilities preserved

#### Team Specialist Input

**Backend Engineer**: "Essential for performance. Pattern matches proven GameBoy Online approach."  
**Frontend Engineer**: "Critical for rendering pipeline performance. Controls maintain interface integrity."  
**Architecture Reviewer**: "Acceptable with proper boundary enforcement and external interface compliance."  

#### **Human Decision Required**: Approve performance-optimized memory access with architectural controls

### 🔑 DECISION POINT 4: HARDWARE ACCURACY VS MAINTAINABILITY BALANCE

#### **Decision Required**  
**Accept hardware accuracy prioritization over abstract maintainability?**

#### Technical Context
Game Boy hardware has specific quirks and behaviors that must be emulated exactly. This sometimes conflicts with "clean" architectural patterns.

#### Team Analysis  
**Unanimous Recommendation**: ✅ **PRIORITIZE HARDWARE ACCURACY WITH MAINTAINABILITY CONTROLS**

**Hardware-Driven Architecture Examples**:
```typescript
// Hardware behavior drives architectural decisions
class PPUMemoryController {
  readVRAM(address: number): number {
    if (!this.isVRAMAccessible()) {
      return 0xFF; // Real hardware behavior, not "clean" abstraction
    }
    return this.vram[address - 0x8000];
  }
  
  // Variable timing matches hardware reality
  calculateMode3Cycles(scanline: number): number {
    let cycles = this.BASE_CYCLES;
    cycles += this.calculateScrollPenalty();    // SCX % 8 penalty
    cycles += this.calculateWindowPenalty();    // Window activation penalty  
    cycles += this.calculateSpritePenalty();    // Per-sprite penalty
    return cycles; // Hardware accuracy over "clean" fixed timing
  }
}
```

**Maintainability Preservation**:
- Hardware behavior documented with authoritative source references
- Complex logic isolated in dedicated components
- Comprehensive test coverage validates all hardware quirks
- Clear code comments explain hardware rationale

#### Validation Strategy

**Hardware Accuracy Validation**:
- 100% Mealybug test ROM passage required
- Pixel-perfect output comparison with real hardware
- Timing-sensitive behavior validated through test ROMs
- Edge case behavior documented and tested

**Maintainability Support**:
- Comprehensive JSDoc with hardware specification references
- Component isolation prevents quirk proliferation
- Test suite documents expected hardware behavior
- Regular validation prevents architectural drift

#### Team Specialist Input

**Product Owner**: "Hardware accuracy is non-negotiable. Mealybug tests validate exact behavior."  
**Test Engineer**: "Hardware test ROMs provide definitive validation. Quirks must match real hardware."  
**Backend Engineer**: "GameBoy Online proves this approach works. Hardware accuracy drives architecture."  
**Architecture Reviewer**: "Acceptable if hardware rationale documented and complexity contained."  

#### **Human Decision Required**: Prioritize hardware accuracy with maintainability safeguards

### 🔑 DECISION POINT 5: TESTING STRATEGY EVOLUTION

#### **Decision Required**  
**Approve evolution from state-snapshot testing to boundary-observation testing?**

#### Technical Context  
Our established TDD workflow uses state snapshots for validation. PPU implementation requires boundary-based testing for hardware accuracy validation.

#### Current vs Proposed Testing Patterns

**Current CPU Testing Pattern**:
```typescript
test('ADD A,B instruction', () => {
  const initialState = createCPUState({ A: 0x10, B: 0x20 });
  const result = executeInstruction(initialState, 0x80); // ADD A,B
  expect(result.registers.A).toBe(0x30);
});
```

**Proposed PPU Testing Pattern**:  
```typescript
test('PPU Mode 1 transition generates VBlank interrupt', () => {
  const system = new GameBoySystem();
  system.runFrames(1); // Run until VBlank
  
  const interrupts = system.getInterruptStatus(); // Boundary observation
  expect(interrupts.vblank).toBe(true);
  
  const ppuState = system.getPPUState(); // Controlled state access
  expect(ppuState.currentMode).toBe(PPUMode.VBlank);
});
```

#### Team Analysis
**Unanimous Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVE BOUNDARY-OBSERVATION TESTING**

**Testing Evolution Benefits**:
- Hardware accuracy validation through proper interfaces
- Screenshot testing enables pixel-perfect validation
- Mealybug test ROM integration for comprehensive coverage
- Maintains TDD workflow while respecting component boundaries

**TDD Workflow Preservation**:
- RED: Write failing test for expected hardware behavior
- GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass test
- REFACTOR: Optimize while maintaining test passage
- VALIDATE: All tests continue passing through changes

#### Test Strategy Validation

**Hardware Accuracy Testing**:
```typescript
// Pixel-perfect hardware validation
test('matches Mealybug sprite priority test output', () => {
  const system = new GameBoySystem();
  system.loadROM(MEALYBUG_SPRITE_PRIORITY_TEST);
  
  const actualOutput = system.runUntilScreenshot();
  const expectedOutput = loadBaseline('mealybug-sprite-priority.png');
  
  expect(actualOutput).toMatchScreenshot(expectedOutput);
});
```

**Integration Testing**:
```typescript
// System behavior validation
test('PPU integration maintains CPU timing accuracy', () => {
  const system = new GameBoySystem();
  system.loadROM(BLARGG_CPU_TIMING_TEST);
  
  const result = system.runUntilSerialOutput();
  expect(result).toContain('Passed'); // No regression in CPU timing
});
```

#### Team Specialist Input

**Test Engineer**: "Boundary observation is correct approach. Maintains TDD while enabling hardware validation."  
**Architecture Reviewer**: "Proper testing architecture. Respects component boundaries."  
**Backend Engineer**: "Essential for hardware accuracy. Test ROMs require this approach."
