# Game Boy DMG Emulator Architecture Documentation

## ARCHITECTURE APPROVED

This directory contains the complete architectural specifications for the Game Boy DMG emulator, designed to achieve native hardware performance (4.194304 MHz) while maintaining comprehensive testability and architectural integrity.

## Architecture Overview

The emulator follows a **component-based architecture** with strict **encapsulation**, **composition over inheritance**, and **interface-driven design**. Each component has clearly defined responsibilities and communicates through well-defined contracts that enable both performance optimization and comprehensive testing.

### Core Architectural Principles

✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear, well-defined purpose  
✅ **Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details hidden behind clean interfaces  
✅ **Interface Design**: Minimal, explicit contracts with inverted dependencies  
✅ **Composition**: Pure composition with dependency injection, no inheritance  
✅ **Testability**: All components testable in isolation via boundary observation  
✅ **Loose Coupling**: Components interact only through defined interfaces  
✅ **Performance**: Native DMG speed with zero-copy operations where possible
