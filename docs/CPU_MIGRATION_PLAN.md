# SM83 CPU Instruction Migration Plan

## Current Status
- **Hand-written**: 185 instructions
- **Generated**: 412 instructions  
- **Total**: 512 instructions
- **Progress**: 36.1%

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Generated code infrastructure in place
- ✅ Incremental executor with compatibility bridge
- ✅ Quality gates applied to generated code
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline integration

### Phase 2: Missing Instruction Implementation
Priority instructions to generate next:
- [ ] 0x0A
- [ ] 0x0B
- [ ] 0x0C
- [ ] 0x0D
- [ ] 0x0E
- [ ] 0x0F
- [ ] 0x1A
- [ ] 0x1B
- [ ] 0x1C
- [ ] 0x1D
- [ ] 0x1E
- [ ] 0x1F
- [ ] 0x2A
- [ ] 0x2B
- [ ] 0x2C
- [ ] 0x2D
- [ ] 0x2E
- [ ] 0x2F
- [ ] 0x3A
- [ ] 0x3B
- ... and 392 more

### Phase 3: Progressive Migration
Migrate hand-written instructions in order of complexity:
- [ ] 0x00 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x01 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x02 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x07 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x17 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x12 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x22 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x32 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x06 (migrate to generated)
- [ ] 0x16 (migrate to generated)
- ... and 175 more

### Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup
- [ ] All instructions using generated implementation
- [ ] Remove hand-written instruction code
- [ ] Update CPU architecture to use only generated executor
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with all test ROMs

## Next Steps

1. **Generate missing instructions**: `npm run codegen:incremental`
2. **Run incremental tests**: `npm test -- --testPathPatterns=incremental`
3. **Migrate one instruction at a time** following TDD principles
4. **Validate with test ROMs** after each migration step

## Quality Assurance

Each migration step must:
- ✅ Pass all existing tests
- ✅ Pass hardware test ROMs (Blargg, Mealybug)
- ✅ Maintain or improve performance
- ✅ Follow strict TypeScript and linting rules
- ✅ Include comprehensive documentation
