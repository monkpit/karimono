/**
 * Summary: Game Boy DMG Interrupt Execution Fix
 *
 * PROBLEM: Game Boy Doctor ROM 2 was failing on DEC B instruction timing,
 * specifically line 151347 showing incorrect interrupt behavior.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED: Interrupt handling was jumping to interrupt vectors
 * but NOT executing the instruction at the vector in the same CPU step.
 *
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Modified CPU.step() to execute one instruction at
 * the interrupt vector when an interrupt occurs, in the same step as the interrupt.
 *
 * RESULTS:
 * ✅ LDH IF Bug Test: FIXED - LDH (0F),A with IF write delay now works correctly
 * ✅ Vector Instruction Execution: FIXED - Instructions at interrupt vectors execute
 * ✅ Interrupt Timing: IMPROVED - More accurate hardware behavior
 * ⚠️  Game Boy Doctor ROM 2 DEC B: PARTIAL - Still needs analysis of specific context
 *
 * TECHNICAL DETAILS:
 * - Interrupt handling now executes: interrupt (20 cycles) + vector instruction (4 cycles)
 * - IF write delay mechanism preserved and working
 * - Maintains backward compatibility with existing interrupt tests
 *
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 1. Product Owner analysis: Game Boy Doctor ROM 2 specific DEC B context
 * 2. Hardware research: Nested interrupt behavior and timing
 * 3. RGBDS documentation review: Interrupt priority and execution order
