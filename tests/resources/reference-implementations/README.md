## Key Research Findings

### Successful Architectural Patterns

1. **Component-Based Design**: All successful emulators use clear component separation (CPU, PPU, APU, Memory)
2. **Cycle-Accurate Timing**: Essential for compatibility with Game Boy software
3. **Centralized Bus Architecture**: Efficient component communication pattern
4. **Performance Optimization**: Critical for maintaining native 4MHz performance
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Hardware validation essential for accuracy

### Performance Optimization Strategies

- **Typed Arrays**: Essential for JavaScript performance
- **Lookup Tables**: Pre-computed instruction decode tables
- **Object Pooling**: Minimize garbage collection in hot paths
- **Direct Memory Access**: Balance abstraction with performance
- **Generated Code**: Compile-time optimization for instruction execution

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing**: Individual component validation
- **Blargg Test ROMs**: CPU instruction and timing accuracy
- **Mealybug Tests**: PPU rendering accuracy validation
- **Hardware Comparison**: Real Game Boy behavior matching
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Native speed maintenance

## Recommended Architecture

Based on our research, we recommend a **hybrid approach** that combines:

### From JSMoo

- Component-based architecture with clear interfaces
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Dependency injection for testability
- Comprehensive test coverage

### From GameBoy Online

- JavaScript performance optimization techniques
- Direct memory access in critical paths
- Efficient browser compatibility
- Minimal runtime overhead

### Our Enhancements

- Object pooling for memory management
- Generated instruction dispatch tables
- Progressive WebAssembly compilation
- Comprehensive hardware validation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Interface Segregation**: Minimal, focused component interfaces
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Components depend on abstractions
4. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complexity through composition
5. **Testability**: All components easily mockable and testable

### Performance Requirements

- Maintain native 4.194304 MHz CPU performance
- Achieve stable 59.7 FPS frame rate
- Provide consistent 44.1 kHz audio output
- Minimize input latency for responsive controls
- Support real-time debugging without performance impact

### Accuracy Standards

- Pass all Blargg CPU test ROMs
- Pass Mealybug PPU accuracy tests
- Match real hardware timing precisely
- Support all common MBC cartridge types
- Provide bit-accurate emulation of all hardware features

## Next Steps

1. **Review Architecture**: Study the recommended patterns in detail
2. **Define Interfaces**: Create component contracts based on research
3. **Implement Core CPU**: Start with SM83 CPU implementation
4. **Build Test Suite**: Establish comprehensive testing from the beginning
5. **Add Components**: Incrementally add PPU, APU, and memory management
6. **Optimize Performance**: Profile and optimize critical execution paths
7. **Validate Accuracy**: Test against real hardware and reference implementations
