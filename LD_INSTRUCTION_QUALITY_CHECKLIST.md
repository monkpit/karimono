- [ ] **Failing Test Confirmation**: Test actually fails for the correct reason (missing implementation)
- [ ] **Clear Failure Messages**: Test failure provides actionable information
- [ ] **Single Behavior Focus**: Each test validates exactly one instruction behavior
- [ ] **Implementation Order**: Tests written BEFORE any implementation code

### Test Structure Standards
- [ ] **Naming Convention**: Test names follow pattern `LD src,dst (0xXX) should [behavior description]`
- [ ] **Hardware Reference**: Test includes opcode, cycle count, and flag effects from opcodes.json
- [ ] **RGBDS Compliance**: References RGBDS GBZ80 documentation where applicable
- [ ] **Boundary Identification**: Edge cases and boundary values clearly identified
- [ ] **Setup Clarity**: Test setup is minimal and focused on single instruction

## Test Implementation Quality Review

### Test Content Standards
- [ ] **Atomic Testing**: Each test validates exactly one behavior/instruction
- [ ] **Fast Execution**: Test executes in sub-second time (no heavy setup)
- [ ] **Debuggable Failures**: Clear assertion messages with expected vs actual values
- [ ] **Real Data Usage**: No fake/dummy values - uses realistic test data
- [ ] **Boundary Coverage**: Tests include 0x00, 0xFF, and memory boundary values

### Hardware Accuracy Verification
- [ ] **Cycle Count Accuracy**: Returned cycle count matches opcodes.json exactly
- [ ] **Flag Behavior Correct**: Flag changes (or preservation) match hardware behavior
- [ ] **Memory Access Pattern**: MMU interactions follow expected read/write patterns
- [ ] **Register State Isolation**: Only intended registers modified by instruction
- [ ] **PC Advancement**: Program counter advances by correct number of bytes

### Group-Specific Requirements

#### Group 1: Register-to-Register (56 instructions)
- [ ] **4-Cycle Timing**: All register-to-register operations return 4 cycles
- [ ] **Flag Preservation**: No flag changes during register copy operations  
- [ ] **Source Preservation**: Source register value unchanged after copy
- [ ] **Self-Copy Handling**: LD r,r (same source/dest) works correctly
- [ ] **Memory LD Distinction**: LD r,(HL) operations return 8 cycles, not 4

#### Group 2: Immediate-to-Register (8 instructions)
- [ ] **8-Cycle Timing**: All immediate loads return 8 cycles
- [ ] **PC Advancement**: Program counter advances by 2 bytes (opcode + immediate)
- [ ] **Memory Read Pattern**: MMU.readByte called for opcode and immediate
- [ ] **Flag Preservation**: No flag changes during immediate loads
- [ ] **Immediate Range**: Tests cover full 8-bit immediate range (0x00-0xFF)

#### Group 3: Memory via Register Pairs (8 instructions)
- [ ] **8-Cycle Timing**: All register pair memory operations return 8 cycles
- [ ] **MMU Integration**: Proper MMU.readByte/writeByte calls with correct addresses
- [ ] **Address Calculation**: 16-bit address correctly formed from register pairs
- [ ] **Memory Boundary**: Tests include access at 0x0000 and 0xFFFF
- [ ] **Register Pair Preservation**: Register pairs unchanged after address calculation

#### Group 4: Advanced Memory Operations (12 instructions)
- [ ] **Increment/Decrement Logic**: HL modified correctly after memory operation
- [ ] **Wraparound Handling**: 0xFFFF+1=0x0000 and 0x0000-1=0xFFFF work correctly
- [ ] **Memory-First Operations**: Memory access occurs BEFORE register modification
- [ ] **Cycle Count Variation**: 8 cycles for most, 12 cycles for LD (HL),n8
- [ ] **Flag Preservation**: No flag changes even with register modification

#### Group 5: 16-bit and Special Operations (4 instructions)
- [ ] **Little-Endian Order**: 16-bit values stored/loaded in correct byte order
- [ ] **Cycle Count Accuracy**: 12 cycles for most, 16 for direct addressing, 20 for LD (a16),SP
- [ ] **Flag Behavior Special Case**: Only LD HL,SP+e8 affects flags (Z=0, N=0, H/C calculated)
- [ ] **Signed Arithmetic**: LD HL,SP+e8 handles signed 8-bit offset correctly
- [ ] **SP Operations**: Stack pointer operations work correctly with 16-bit values

## Common Anti-Patterns to Reject

### TDD Violations (IMMEDIATE REJECTION)
- ❌ **Tests written after implementation**: Violates fundamental TDD principle

- ❌ **Fake data usage**: Reduces confidence in real-world behavior

### Quality Issues (REQUIRES CORRECTION)

- ❌ **Unclear failure messages**: Assertion failures don't provide actionable information
- ❌ **Missing boundary testing**: Edge cases and boundary values not covered
- ❌ **Disabled tests without documentation**: Tests disabled without proper justification

### Architecture Violations (ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW REQUIRED)
