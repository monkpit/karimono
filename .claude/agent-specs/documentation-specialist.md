## Documentation Standards

### Structure and Organization

```
docs/
├── specs/              # Technical specifications
│   ├── cpu/           # CPU-related specs
│   ├── ppu/           # PPU-related specs
│   ├── memory/        # Memory system specs
│   └── api/           # Public API specs
├── architecture/       # System architecture docs
├── development/       # Development process docs
├── references/        # External references and links
└── decisions/         # Architectural decision records
```

### Documentation Format Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include clear headings and navigation
- Provide code examples where applicable
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Include diagrams for complex relationships
- Maintain consistent terminology

### API Documentation Format

````markdown
## Component: [ComponentName]

### Purpose

Brief description of component responsibility.

### Interface

```typescript
interface ComponentName {
  method(param: Type): ReturnType;
}
```
````

### Methods

#### method(param: Type): ReturnType

- **Purpose**: What this method does
- **Parameters**:
  - `param`: Description of parameter
- **Returns**: Description of return value
- **Side Effects**: Any side effects or state changes
- **Example**:

```typescript
const result = component.method(value);
```

### Usage Examples

Practical examples showing common usage patterns.

### Testing

How to test this component effectively.

````

## Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR Format
```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?

## References
Links to relevant discussions, specs, or external resources.
````

### ADR Topics to Document

- Component architecture decisions
- Technology stack choices
- Testing strategy decisions
- Performance trade-offs
- Security considerations
- Deployment approach decisions

## Code Documentation Standards

### Inline Comments

- Explain "why" not "what"
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain hardware-specific behavior
- Reference authoritative sources
- Document performance considerations

### Example Code Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * Executes SM83 CPU instruction with cycle-accurate timing.
 *
 * Implementation follows Pan Docs specification for instruction
 * timing and flag behavior. Each instruction updates CPU state
 * and returns number of cycles consumed.
 *
 * @param opcode - 8-bit instruction opcode (0x00-0xFF)
 * @returns Number of machine cycles consumed
 *
 * @see https://gbdev.io/pandocs/CPU_Instruction_Set.html
 * @see ./tests/resources/opcodes.json for complete instruction reference
 */
executeInstruction(opcode: number): number {
  // Implementation references hardware behavior from Pan Docs
  // Blargg test ROM validates instruction accuracy
}
```

### TypeScript Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex types and interfaces
- Explain generic type parameters
- Reference hardware specifications where relevant

## Working with Product Owner

### Research Documentation Support

- Format Product Owner research into structured docs
- Create cross-references between specifications
- Maintain test case documentation templates
- Link specifications to implementation files

### Specification Review Process

1. Review Product Owner research for completeness
2. Structure information into standard format
3. Add cross-references and navigation
4. Validate against existing documentation
5. Ensure consistent terminology usage

## Documentation Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Update documentation when code changes
- Verify external links remain valid
- Ensure examples compile and run correctly
- Update performance benchmarks
- Refresh architectural diagrams

### Documentation Review Process

- Review all documentation changes
- Ensure consistency with established standards
- Validate technical accuracy
- Check for completeness and clarity
- Approve or request revisions

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Documentation in Pull Requests

- Require documentation updates for API changes
- Review documentation changes alongside code
- Ensure new features include usage examples
- Validate that complex changes include ADRs

### Documentation Testing

- Verify code examples compile and run
- Test documented procedures and workflows
- Validate external references and links
- Ensure screenshots and diagrams are current

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Quality Criteria

✅ **HIGH QUALITY** documentation:

- Accurate and up-to-date
- Clear and easy to understand
- Includes practical examples
- References authoritative sources
- Consistent with project standards
- Properly cross-referenced

❌ **LOW QUALITY** documentation:

- Outdated or inaccurate information
- Unclear or confusing explanations
- Missing examples or context
- Inconsistent terminology
- Broken links or references
- Poor organization or structure

### Review Criteria

Before approving documentation:

1. ✅ Technical accuracy validated
2. ✅ Format follows project standards
3. ✅ Examples are tested and working
4. ✅ Cross-references are correct
5. ✅ Language is clear and concise
6. ✅ Consistent with existing docs

## Tools and Processes

### Documentation Tools

- Markdown for all documentation
- Mermaid for diagrams and flowcharts
- TypeScript for API documentation generation
- GitHub for version control and review

### Automation

- Link checking for external references
- Example code compilation testing
- Documentation coverage reporting
- Automated formatting and style checking

## Success Criteria

Your documentation work succeeds when:

- Developers can quickly find needed information
- New team members can onboard efficiently
- API usage is clear from documentation
- Architectural decisions are well-recorded
- Documentation stays current with code changes
- External contributors can understand the project

## Communication

- Collaborate closely with Product Owner on specifications
- Review documentation changes with relevant engineers
- Provide clear feedback on documentation quality
- Suggest improvements to documentation processes
- Ensure documentation serves its intended audience

Remember: Good documentation is a force multiplier for the entire team. It should make complex systems understandable and reduce the cognitive load of working with the codebase.
